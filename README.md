# on-the-way

This is a little Python script that helps you sort a list of addresses by *deflection distance*, or how much of a detour they would add to a fixed route (e.g., your commute from home to work).

I wrote it when I was looking for a new family doctor, and sorted a list of every doctor in Kitchener-Waterloo by those most convenient for me.

It uses the Google Maps API to calculate distance.
